basic formatting for making new stuffs:

save (this is present at the top of every file)
money # (how much money u got!)

type (weapons must be in the stats file)
name (e.g. pistol, must be directly after 'type', NOTE: other parameters do not need to be in this order)
damage # (damage per shot on weapons, def 0)
volley # (number of shots per ammo, mainly used for shotguns, def 1)
fire_rate # (# is added each frame up to 60, if # is equal to 1.5 it shoots 1.5 times a second, etc.)
proj_speed #  (*60 for pixels per sec, def 10, for melee weapons this is how fast the swing will be)
ammo # (number of bullets before needing to reload, -1 means it will never run out, def -1)
reload # (number of seconds to reload, def 1)
inaccuracy # (inaccuracy of the weapon in degrees, can be a float.)
recoil # (degrees it becomes more inaccurate per shot, decreases exponentially, decreasing by 0.03x the difference and 0.005 flat)
speed # (1 = no effect on speed, multiplier, turrets would have a 0 cuz u cant move. Please dont use negatives!)
image insertImgName (name of the image in the weapons/ folder. All pictures should be 75x75 and .png, second frame has a "1" appended to the beginning)
bullet normal (30x30 sprite for the bullet in folder bullets/)
effect small_exp (90x90 sprite when the projectile hits something
sound (name of the sound file .wav)
sound_death (name of the sound file when it explodes .wav)
special "" (name of a special effect, currently accepts: "phase", "melee")
sound_hit (name of the sound file when it hits an enemy, similar to sound_death)
cost # (def 0)
owned 0 (1 if it can be bought in the store, 0 if it cannot)
end (put this after all the weapon stats)

type enemy (enemies must be in the enemies file)
name(names must be unique maybe idk, should be written directly after "type")
health # (integer)
weapon (name of a weapon)
img (name of the image in the enemy_pic/ folder. All pictures should be asdf)
hitbox # (integer, the length/height of the square for the hitbox, more complicated hitboxes later[tm])
frequency # (how common enemies are, uncommon enemies become more common later on, and should be stronger. Usually a number between 1 and 10)
movespeed # (float, pixels per frame, player has 5.0 mov_speed)
boss # (1 = true, 0 = false. Bosses have their own spawning conditions and music)
end

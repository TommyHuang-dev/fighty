basic formatting for making new stuffs:

save (this is present at the top of every file)
money # (how much money u got!)

type (currently "weapon" is the only type)
name (e.g. pistol, must be directly after 'type', NOTE: other parameters do not need to be in this order)
damage # (damage per shot on weapons, def 1)
fire_rate # (# is added each frame up to 60, if # is equal to 1.5 it shoots 1.5 times a second, etc.)
proj_speed #  (*60 for pixels per sec, def 10)
ammo # (number of bullets before needing to reload, -1 means it will never run out, def -1)
reload # (number of seconds to reload, def 1)
inaccuracy # (inaccuracy of the weapon in degrees, can be a float.)
recoil # (degrees it becomes more inaccurate per shot, decreases exponentially, decreasing by 0.03x the difference and 0.005 flat)
special specName (unused right now, but tags such as "pierce" for sniper will be added)
image insertImgName (name of the image in the weapons/ folder. All pictures should be 75x75 and .png)
bullet normal (30x30 sprite for the bullet in folder bullets/)
effect small_exp (90x90 sprite when the projectile hits something
cost # (def 0)
owned 0 (becomes 1 if you own it, def 0)
end (put this after all the weapon stats)

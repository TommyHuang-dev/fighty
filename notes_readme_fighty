basic formatting for making new stuffs:

save (this is present at the top of every file)
money # (how much money u got!)

type (weapons must be in the stats file)
name (e.g. pistol, must be directly after 'type', NOTE: other parameters do not need to be in this order)
damage # (damage per shot on weapons, def 1)
fire_rate # (# is added each frame up to 60, if # is equal to 1.5 it shoots 1.5 times a second, etc.)
proj_speed #  (*60 for pixels per sec, def 10, for melee weapons this is how fast the swing will be)
ammo # (number of bullets before needing to reload, -1 means it will never run out, def -1)
reload # (number of seconds to reload, def 1)
inaccuracy # (inaccuracy of the weapon in degrees, can be a float.)
recoil # (degrees it becomes more inaccurate per shot, decreases exponentially, decreasing by 0.03x the difference and 0.005 flat)
speed # (1 = no effect on speed, multiplier, turrets would have a 0 cuz u cant move. Please dont use negatives!)
image insertImgName (name of the image in the weapons/ folder. All pictures should be 75x75 and .png, second frame has a "1" appended to the beginning)
bullet normal (30x30 sprite for the bullet in folder bullets/)
effect small_exp (90x90 sprite when the projectile hits something
sound (name of the sound file .wav)
sound_death (name of the sound file when it explodes .wav)
cost # (def 0)
owned 0 (becomes 1 if you own it, def 0)
end (put this after all the weapon stats)

type enemy (enemies must be in the enemies file)
name(names must be unique maybe idk, should be written directly after "type")
health # (integer)
weapon (name of a weapon)
img (name of the image in the enemy_pic/ folder. All pictures should be asdf)
hitbox # (integer, the length/height of the square for the hitbox, more complicated hitboxes later[tm])
rarity # (how common enemies are, uncommon enemies become more common later on, and should be stronger)
movespeed # (float, pixels per frame, player has 5.0 mov_speed)
boss # (1 = true, 0 = false. Bosses have their own spawning conditions and music)
end
